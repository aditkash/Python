# What virtual environment does?
# Virtual Environment saves the current state of our compiler along with the state of their modules and libraries. 
# So in this way even if Python has made certain changes in its module, our virtual environment can still work as before even after years. 
# We can also install different packages and “dataframes” in our virtual environment.
# To be more clear, the virtual environment works exactly the same way as the Python we have installed on our windows/mac/Linux currently 
# because a virtual environment is just a clone of the original product.
